Business problem to be solved
How to save money the smart way? 
Media is full of information about stocks of companies, this is overwhelming. Often times there are too many resources with too much information (prices, fundamental data, analysts opinion) to check.
Stock recommender will help investors looking in the right corners in the investment universe giving a selection of high potential companies to focus analysis on. 
Objective
Goal of the project is to build a recommender system to empower investors in making better investment decisions
MVP
Database via (bonus: web scraping)/ API - Reference database in MySQL with schema via YFinance
Prototype user interface to enter a company name or ticker symbol or industry to see the high potential companies based on the user input
Based on KPIs (Return [EBIT] on capital employed, Return [EBIT] on EV)company will be ranked - sector-industry - size (net sales) - region
Stock will be first checked if in a list of companies that are being seen as high quality (can be growth, etc.) companies that are advised by stock analysts. 
Stock will be benchmarked against others in the industry/ sector and size. The result will be a list of companies with a ranking based on the price (instead of list tableau dashboard?)
